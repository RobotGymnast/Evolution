This is a collection of projects centered around reducing the amount of pre-made content, and instead, generating content on-the-fly.
A list of projects is available here:

 * **Growth**: Investigating properties of self-propogating and interacting objects

 * **Evolution**: A fairly undeveloped project where small "organisms" are intended to create their own code for behaviors
